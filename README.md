# Dynamic Programming

When preparing for Dynamic Programming (DP) in Java, there are several key topics and problem types you should focus on. Here’s a structured guide:

### 1. **Introduction to Dynamic Programming (DP) Concepts:**
- **Memoization (Top-Down):** Recursive solutions with memoization to store already computed results.
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up):** Iterative solutions to build up from base cases.
- **Sub problems & Optimal Substructure:** Identifying subproblems and how solutions to these subproblems can be combined to solve larger problems.
- **State Transition:** Understanding how to derive the next state from the current state.

### 2. **Famous Problems for Practice:**
Focus on understanding the problem statements and designing both memoization and tabulation approaches.

#### 1D DP Problems:
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** Classic example to introduce DP.
    - Problem: Find the nth Fibonacci number.
- **Climbing Stairs:** How many ways to climb `n` stairs when you can take either 1 or 2 steps.
- **Min Cost Climbing Stairs:** Cost associated with each step, and you need to minimize the total cost to reach the top.
- **House Robber:** Maximize the amount of money you can rob from non-adjacent houses.
- **Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm):** Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
- **Jump Game (I & II):** Determine if you can reach the end of the array (I) and the minimum number of jumps required (II).

#### 2D DP Problems:
- **Unique Paths:** Count the number of distinct paths to reach the bottom-right corner of a grid from the top-left.
- **Minimum Path Sum:** Find the minimum path sum to reach the bottom-right corner of a grid.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):** Given two strings, find the length of their longest common subsequence.
- **Edit Distance:** Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into another.
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Maximize the value of items you can put into a knapsack with a weight limit.
- **Subset Sum Problem:** Determine if there's a subset of numbers that sums up to a target value.

#### Sequence-Based Problems:
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** Find the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
- **Longest Palindromic Subsequence:** Find the longest subsequence in a string that reads the same forward and backward.
- **Longest Palindromic Substring:** Find the longest contiguous substring that is a palindrome.

### 3. **Advanced DP Topics:**
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication:** Minimize the number of multiplications required to multiply a chain of matrices.
- **Egg Dropping Problem:** Find the minimum number of trials required to find the critical floor from which an egg breaks.
- **Rod Cutting Problem:** Maximize the profit by cutting a rod into pieces.
- **Coin Change (I & II):**
    - Coin Change I: Minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount.
    - Coin Change II: Total number of ways to make a certain amount with given coin denominations.
- **Partition Equal Subset Sum:** Determine if you can partition an array into two subsets with equal sums.
- **Word Break:** Determine if a string can be segmented into a sequence of dictionary words.
- **Wildcard Matching/Regular Expression Matching:** Matching strings with patterns containing wildcards or regular expressions.
- **Painting Fence Algorithm:** Number of ways to paint a fence with `n` posts and `k` colors.

### 4. **Optimization Techniques in DP:**
- **Space Optimization:** Reducing space complexity by eliminating the need to store the entire DP table, usually by keeping track of only a few previous states (e.g., using rolling arrays).
- **Bitmasking and DP:** Useful for problems involving subsets and combinations (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem).
- **DP with Binary Search:** Combining DP with binary search for problems like LIS using patience sorting.
- **DP with Trees:** Problems that involve dynamic programming on trees, like finding the diameter of a tree or maximizing a sum path.

### 5. **General Steps to Approach DP Problems:**
1. **Identify the problem as a DP problem** by looking for overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
2. **Define the state:** What is the meaning of `dp[i]`? Is it the solution to a subproblem?
3. **State transition:** Figure out how to move from one state to another, i.e., how `dp[i]` depends on previous states.
4. **Base case:** Set up the initial state(s) for the DP array or recursive call.
5. **Solve either recursively (top-down with memoization) or iteratively (bottom-up with tabulation).**

### 6. **Key Java Concepts for DP:**
- **Arrays and Matrices:** DP problems typically involve manipulating arrays (1D or 2D). Ensure you're comfortable with array indexing and loops.
- **Recursion:** Java recursion can be tricky with large input sizes, so understanding stack limits and recursion depth is crucial.
- **Memoization with HashMaps:** For more complex problems, use `HashMap` for memoization when the states are not simple integers (e.g., when memoizing states of strings or combinations).

### 7. **Popular DP Challenges on Platforms:**
- **LeetCode:** Problems tagged with `Dynamic Programming`.
- **Codeforces & CodeChef:** Competitive programming platforms that frequently feature DP-based problems.
- **HackerRank:** Practice sections focused on dynamic programming.

By mastering these topics and problem types, you'll build a strong foundation in dynamic programming with Java, making you well-prepared for interviews and coding challenges.
